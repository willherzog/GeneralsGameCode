The debugging module is pretty good for debugging and it has some message
printing stuff as well.  The basic idea is that you write a class that
inherits from OutputDevice (several are provided) and assign that output
device to a stream.  There are seperate streams for debugging, information,
warning, and error messages.  Each one can have a seperate output device,
or they can all have the same one.  Debugging messages only get compiled
in if your module defines 'DEBUG'. If you don't define debug, then not even
the text of the debugging message gets into the binary.   All the other
output streams get printed regardless of whether DEBUG is defined.

Sample usage:
FileD debug_device("gameres.debug");     // create a file device
MsgManager::setDebugStream(&debug_device);
DBGMSG("This debug message #" << 1 << " you use C++ streams");

Note that since these are defines you really don't need to put a semicolon
at the end, and it can be bad in situations like this:

if (x)
  DBGMSG("Stuff is broken");
else
  DBGMSG("Stuff is NOT broken");

This won't compile, read the code until you figure it out.  Only then
will you be ready to leave grasshopper.
