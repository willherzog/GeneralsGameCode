# Test Replays

The GeneralsReplays folder contains replays and the required maps that are tested in CI to ensure that the game is retail compatible.

You can also test with these replays locally:
- Copy the replays into a subfolder in your `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data/Replays` folder.
- Copy the maps into `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data/Maps`
- Start the test with this: (copy into a .bat file next to your executable)
```
START /B /W generalszh.exe -jobs 4 -headless -replay subfolder/*.rep > replay_check.log
echo %errorlevel%
PAUSE
```
It will run the game in the background and check that each replay is compatible. You need to use a VC6 build with optimizations and RTS_BUILD_OPTION_DEBUG = OFF, otherwise the game won't be compatible.
