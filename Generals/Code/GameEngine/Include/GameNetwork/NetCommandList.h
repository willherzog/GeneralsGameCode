/**
 * The NetCommandList is a ordered linked list of NetCommandRef objects.
 * The list is ordered based on the command id, player id, and command type.
 * It is ordered in this way to aid in constructing the packets efficiently.
 * The list keeps track of the last message inserted in order to accommodate
 * adding commands in order more efficiently since that is whats going to be
 * done most of the time.  If the new message doesn't go after the last message
 * inserted, then the list will be traversed linearly until the proper spot is
 * found.  We can get away with this inefficient method since these occurances
 * will be rare.  Also, the list is not expected to ever have more than 30 or so
 * commands on it at a time.  Five commands would probably be a normal amount.
