# Welcome to the Generals Game Code Project

GeneralsGameCode is a community-driven project aimed at fixing and improving the classic RTS game, *Command &
Conquer: Generals* and its expansion *Zero Hour*. This repository contains the source code for both games, with a
primary focus on *Zero Hour*.

Additionally, there is a complementary project repository for fixing and improving game data and assets such as
INI scripts, GUI, AI, maps, models, textures, audio, localization. You can find it
[here](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGamePatch/) and contribute to it as well.

## Project Overview

The game was originally developed using Visual Studio 6 and C++98. We've updated the code to be compatible with Visual
Studio 2022 and C++20.

The initial goal of this project is to fix critical bugs and implement improvements while maintaining compatibility with
the original *Generals* version 1.08 and *Zero Hour* version 1.04. Once we can break retail compatibility, more fixes
and features will be possible to implement.

## Current Focus and Future Plans

Here's an overview of our current focus and future plans

- **Modernizing the Codebase**: Transitioning to modern C++ standards and refactoring old code.
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Fixing game-breaking issues (e.g., fullscreen crash).
- **Minor Bug Fixes**: Addressing minor bugs (e.g., UI issues, graphical glitches).
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Adding support for more platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS).
- **Engine Improvements**: Enhancing the game engine to improve performance and stability.
- **Client-Side Features**: Enhancing the game's client with features such as an improved replay viewer and UI updates.
- **Multiplayer Improvements**: Implementing a new game server and an upgraded matchmaking lobby.
- **Tooling Improvements**: Developing new or improving existing tools for modding and game development.
- **Community-Driven Improvements**: Once the community grows, we plan to incorporate more features, updates, and
  changes based on player feedback.

## Running the Game

To run *Generals* or *Zero Hour* using this project, you need to have the original *Command & Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour* game
installed. The easiest way to get it is through *Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection*
on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/39394). Once the game is ready, download the latest version of the
project from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode/releases), extract the necessary 
files, and follow the instructions in the [Wiki](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode/wiki).
